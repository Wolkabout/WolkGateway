wolkgateway (4.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Created WolkDefault and WolkExternal that provide different interfaces for custom subdevice data providing.
  * Introduced the FSFileRepository to provide info about FileManagement files from the File System.
  * Disabled the Gateway Update message sending and mechanisms as they have been found unnecessary.
  * Imported the newest WolkSDK-Cpp that introduces various fixes and improvements.
  * Moved the version file when firmware installing to a different location. Also, finishing the install method with `true` now reports success.
  * Introduced the custom data and device status protocols, that allow us to define custom MQTT topics/payloads for those messages.
  * Added the FileListener interface for FileManagementService to allow input into the File Management process and allow for hooks.
  * Made optimizations for the application to be built as a submodule.
