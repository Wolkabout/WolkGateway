wolkgateway (4.2.9) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed the gateway update to allow us to pass if it has already been updated.
  * Disabled the gateway update fow now, as it doesn't really have a purpose right now.
  * Imported newest WolkSDK-Cpp that allows for optional `description` properties in JsonDto messages.
